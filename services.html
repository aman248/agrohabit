                    <p>Knowing the Soil is where it all starts – the nutrient content and chemical composition of the soil defines how fertile the soil is and what level of plant life it can support and sustain on a consistent basis.

                        We help our farmers get the soil test done at our testing labs or bring in their existing soil health cards. Soil composition data points provide foundations for selecting the right kind of Agri Input (seed/fertilizer) and to generate advanced analytics e.g. yield predictions and Personalized Advisory.</p>

Our Technology Solution integrates all services on a single platform that includes last mile connection to the farmers doorstep including Agri Input he needs for next planting.</p>

                    <p><strong>Harvest & Market Access</strong></p>
                    <p>Agri Output is cumulative result of nature’s bounty and farmers ingenuity and hard work even so, unfortunately that does not always translate to deserving monetary rewards for the farmer.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Variety of “middlemen” and logistical hurdles become serious impediments between Farmers and high-paying Institutional Buyers, resulting in lack of price transparency for farmer, price increase at both ends due to multiple handling, as well as post-harvest losses. In this process farmers do not receive good farm gate prices for their produce.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>There is tremendous scope of technology-enabled disruption and development in this sector. Agrohabit Technology Solution has been designed to create a transparent marketplace to provide direct market access to farmers and a reliable supply chain for large institutional buyers. With our “last mile connection” with the farmers and their farms, we continue direct on-field monitoring over quantity and quality over the produce growth cycle and provide full logistical support for harvesting and transportation, storage at conveniently located agrohabit Collection Centers – thus eliminating distress selling and the meddling middlemen that has been affecting Farmers in India for generations. This has resulted an increment of up to 20% gate prices for the farmer.</p>
